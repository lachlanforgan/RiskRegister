In addition, research in Educational Technology Research and Development discusses the development of an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework. This framework addresses the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university teaching and learning, advocating for policies that consider ethical, technical, and pedagogical dimensions. Moreover, the University of Illinois College of Education outlines practical benefits of AI in classrooms, such as providing immediate feedback to students and assisting teachers in content creation. The article also cautions about potential drawbacks, including over-reliance on AI and the risk of diminishing critical thinking skills. These studies collectively suggest that successful AI implementation in education requires a balanced approach that integrates technological advancements with thoughtful pedagogical strategies and robust policy frameworks.
	The final scope of the paper is going to examine areas needing more research, and any complications involving said research. Due to this, no academic sources are going to be engaged with or examined as that section is involved primarily in the examination of an inexistence of research. Therefore, this concludes the literature review for this paper.
History of AI
To understand the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern education, it is essential to first trace its historical development. AI is not a new concept, nor is its application in education entirely unprecedented. Rather, AI has evolved over nearly eight decades of research, innovation, and experimentation—progressing from theoretical constructs to real-world systems now shaping how students and educators interact with knowledge and technology.
The term artificial intelligence was formally coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, where researchers first speculated on the possibility of machines simulating human intelligence. One of the foundational moments in AI's history was the development of the Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, which framed the question of machine intelligence in terms of whether a human could distinguish a computer's responses from a human's in a natural-language conversation. This test, while not a definitive measure of intelligence, established a philosophical and practical baseline that still influences modern AI design [5].
Following its conceptual birth, AI development in the mid-to-late 20th century focused on rule-based and symbolic systems. In the 1960s and 1970s, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) emerged, where early educational software attempted to deliver personalized learning experiences based on predefined logic trees. This marked AI's earliest entry into educational contexts, albeit in a limited form. The 1980s saw the introduction of expert systems—computer programs designed to mimic human decision-making by encoding expert-level knowledge in specific domains. These systems paved the way for more adaptive AI models and were among the first to demonstrate AI’s potential in professional and academic settings [9].
A significant milestone occurred when machine learning (ML) and neural networks became more viable in the late 20th century. These models shifted AI design away from hardcoded logic and toward systems that learn from data. According to IBM's 2024 timeline, developments such as deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning revolutionized AI’s capabilities and set the stage for applications such as chatbots, image classifiers, and adaptive learning platforms [8]. Understanding the sequence in which these mechanisms evolved—ML in the 1980s, NLP and backpropagation in the 1990s, deep learning in the 2010s—is vital for contextualizing the current generation of AI tools used in education.
The history of AI in education specifically reflects both this technological evolution and the shifting goals of educational institutions. A 2024 article by Ahmed offers a structured overview of AI’s educational history, categorizing its development by decade. In the 1960s and 70s, AI-enabled learning environments were rudimentary, often confined to basic tutorials and simulations. However, with the advent of desktop computing and stronger processing capabilities in the 1980s and 90s, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) began to take form. These systems represented one of the earliest significant uses of AI in personalized learning, combining rule-based logic with user modeling to deliver tailored instruction and feedback [14].
A similar trajectory is observed in the broader educational sector. Teachflow’s 2023 review traces the shift from skepticism to experimentation and eventual adoption of AI tools in education. This evolution was especially pronounced in the 2010s and 2020s, when the proliferation of generative AI (GenAI) tools—such as GPT-3, ChatGPT, and other large language models—transformed how students and educators engaged with content creation, assessment, and feedback. These tools differ from earlier AI models not only in complexity but in their conversational interfaces, making them far more accessible for everyday academic use [13] [15].
This historical context is crucial because it reveals that the current surge in generative AI usage is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a longer continuum of development. It also highlights that while GenAI may seem novel due to its ease of access and interactive interface, it is deeply rooted in decades of research, experimentation, and iteration. Understanding this lineage helps educators and policymakers better assess how to manage and integrate AI responsibly, especially when weighed against earlier efforts to embed AI in structured, institutional contexts.
As the next sections of this paper will explore, this long-standing evolution—from rule-based instruction to real-time, autonomous content generation—has created new opportunities and challenges in educational environments. By appreciating the historical arc of AI’s development, we can better understand the foundations upon which current educational tools are built, and more clearly anticipate where the field may be heading.
